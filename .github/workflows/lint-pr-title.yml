# NOTE: This workflow deviates from the normal convention of using a single
# workflow as an entrypoint or trigger for other re-usable workflows. The reason
# for this is it needs to be triggered for a variety of PR events, including
# `edited`, when the title changes â€” where we do *not* want to trigger the
# entire suite of CI checks. We also cannot use `if` or `needs` triggers to
# filter which steps we need to run, as if we skip certain checks, we do not
# have visibility on the code quality or security of the PR.
